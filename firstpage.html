    <h2>What We're About</h2>
    <p>
        Ally Pally's is a cafe/bar based in Leeds City Centre,
         serving good food, beer and cocktails, and an amazing 
         wine list to boot! Live music is our jam, we 
         try to have as many acts on through the week as possible! 
         Mondays are our Jam night where anyone can bring an instrument 
         and play along, Thursday is our jazz night where we bring in 
         any range of people ranging from a cocktail jazz trio to fusion 
         collective of 9-12 members! Friday is our UK Bangers night and Saturdays are also reserved for live music or DJs.
         <br> <br> Our opening times are between 08:00-am til Midnight except Sundays where we close at 11pm!
