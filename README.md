# Project 1- HTML and CSS
This is a website for a cafe called Ally Pally's. It is a live music venue that sells a variety of food and alcoholic drinks.

## Requirements
The website was desinged so the user can find out everything they need to know about the cafe. It has an intoductory paragraph that talks about the emphasis of live music in the establishment and the user can go on further to find out what it has going on through the week, the opening and closing times, what food and drinks it serves and their times, and it's prices. There is also information about it's location, phone number and social media links in the footer, and if the user wants to find out more about our events or any other queries then there is a contact page that has a form they can fill out.

The website can be accessed through this [link](https://alistairdriscoll.github.io/firstproject/)

## Features

### Header
The header is near enough the exact same code accross all pages which has the name as a h1 in big contrasting letters to the background picture. The background picture, like all others in the project is a closeup picture of a musician playing their instrument. I deliberately chose all pictures to have the musician facing away from the camera, to accent the fact that they are playing to a live audience to emphasise that the establishment is a live music venue. I chose the guitar as the first picture because the color scheme came from me choosing a shade from the middle of the guitar and finding matching colors after to go with it. 

The H1 in the middle of the header which displays the name of the cafe is written in a font I found online called Barriecito. I chose this font because I knew the rest of the website a lot of the time would have darker sort of moodier colors to suit the whole jazz aspect of the cafe so I wanted to use something more casual and friendly for the headers and other important parts.

-The nav bar is on the bottom of the header, to position it at the top of the page at all times. The different links are spread across the navbar:
    +The Homepage hyperlink is a link to take you to the home page of the website where the user can find out more about the cafe, it's events and what it has going on.
    +The Menus hyperlink takes you to where the menus are, and the Contact link takes the user to a page with a contact form to fill out.

-The links all have a hover effect added to emphasise to the user that they can be interacted with.

## The Homepage

The homepage, or the index.html page starts with an introductory 'what we're about' section informing the user about the cafes emphasis on live jazz music, and what to expect on some of the nights in the week. It also has it's opening times in bold text on another line of the page to mark it out as important information that the user therefore will not miss.

The 'on this week' section that follows has a picture of the highlight act of the week, a local band with a picture to the left of a desktop screen or on the bottom of a phone screen, and a description of the band and more bold text to emphasise when the doors open for the event. Another link is in this section which invites the user to the websites contact page if they are interested in attending.

### The footer

The other mutual feature between all pages is the footer, which has links to the cafes social media pages. Code is included to open up a new tab for the links so the customer will not leave the website, and the links just take you to the main pages of the websites as the cafe is fictitious and doesn't actually have any social media pages. An address and contact number is also provided in the footer thus giving all the user all the important information about the cafe, including the opening times, all of the events of the week, address and contact number by the time they have read through the first page, should they wish to get in touch or visit.
